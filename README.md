Machine Learning with Climate Data

Project Overview

This repository contains scripts, models, and analysis related to predicting climate patterns in Europe using advanced machine learning techniques. The goal of the project is to assess weather patterns, detect deviations from historical norms, and forecast future trends, which will help identify regions most susceptible to extreme weather and determine safer areas for habitation.

Key Tools and Techniques

Keras Framework: Used for building and training neural network models, including CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks) and RNNs (Recurrent Neural Networks), which allow for complex pattern recognition in weather-related datasets.

CNNs: Convolutional Neural Networks help detect spatial patterns in weather imagery, such as identifying cloud formations or changes in precipitation. These models provide high accuracy for categorizing weather conditions.

RNNs: Recurrent Neural Networks are used to capture temporal dependencies in sequential data, such as time-series weather data, and can be applied for long-term weather trend analysis.

Random Forests: A powerful ensemble learning technique used for both classification and regression tasks. In this project, Random Forests help in feature importance ranking and risk categorisation, which is crucial for understanding the impact of various weather factors (temperature, humidity, wind, etc.) on future climate projections.
